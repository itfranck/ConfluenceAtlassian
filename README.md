# Confluence

Perform document automation and interact with Confluence Atlassian REST API easily

## Installation
`Install-Module ConfluenceAtlassian`

## Introduction

This module was made with the idea to ease document automation that I already made on a semi-regular basis. It offer cmdlet to interact more seamlessly with Confluence and update pages. 

It is not meant to cover every possible scenario but the most straight forward ones. 

Get pages and update them along with some utilities to find and replace tables in a page (for semi-automated documentation where only tables are dynamic)

## Planned feature
You can view the open issues to get a generic idea of what is planned. For V1.0, it revolves around

- Better table generation (conditionnal row /cell formatting, support for bold / italic items, etc... )
- Additional macros (Expand / Code)
- Additional cmdlet to support document automation (remove old versions / find pages by title / space / keywords, etc...)
